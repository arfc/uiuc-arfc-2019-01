	abstract = {The molten-salt-cooled Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (AHTR) is a new reactor concept designed to provide very high-temperature (750 to 1000{\textdegree}C) heat to enable efficient low-cost thermochemical production of hydrogen (H2) or production of electricity. This paper provides an initial description and technical analysis of its key features. The proposed AHTR uses coated-particle graphite-matrix fuel similar to that used in high-temperature gas-cooled reactors (HTGRs), such as the General Atomics gas turbine-modular helium reactor. However, unlike the HTGRs, the AHTR uses a molten-salt coolant and a pool configuration, similar to that of the General Electric Super Power Reactor Inherently Safe Module (S-PRISM) liquid-metal reactor. Because the boiling points for molten fluoride salts are near 1400{\textdegree}C, the reactor can operate at very high temperatures and atmospheric pressure. For thermochemical H2 production, the heat is delivered at the required near-constant high temperature and low pressure. For electricity production, a multireheat helium Brayton (gas-turbine) cycle, with efficiencies {\textgreater}50\%, is used. The low-pressure molten-salt coolant, with its high heat capacity and natural circulation heat transfer capability, creates the potential for robust safety (including fully passive decay-heat removal) and improved economics with passive safety systems that allow higher power densities and scaling to large reactor sizes [{\textgreater}1000 MW(electric)].},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors have seen a marked resurgence of interest over the past decade, highlighted by their inclusion as one of six Generation IV reactor types. The most active development period however was between the mid 1950s and early 1970s at Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL) and any new re-examination of this concept must bear in mind the far different priorities then in place. High breeding ratios and short doubling times were paramount and this guided the evolution of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) program. As the inherent advantages of the molten salt concept have become apparent to an increasing number of researchers worldwide it is important to not simply look to continue where ORNL left off but to return to basics in order to offer the best design using updated goals and abilities. A major potential change to the traditional Single Fluid, MSBR design and a subject of this presentation is a return to the mode of operation that ORNL proposed for the majority of its MSR program. That being the Two Fluid design in which separate salts are used for fissile 233UF4 and fertile ThF4. Oak Ridge abandoned this promising route due to what was known as the {\textquotedblleft}plumbing problem{\textquotedblright}. It will be shown that a simple yet crucial modification to core geometry can solve this problem and enable the many advantages of the Two Fluid design. In addition, another very promising route laid out by ORNL was simplified Single Fluid converter reactors that could obtain far superior lifetime uranium utilization than LWR or CANDU without the need for any fuel processing beyond simple chemistry control. Updates and potential improvements to this very attractive concept will also be explored.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the development, validation, and results of a three-dimensional, time- dependent, coupled-neutronics{\textendash}thermal-hydraulic calculational scheme for channel-type molten salt re- actors (MSRs). The reactor physics part is based on diffusion theory, extended by a term representing the flow of the fuel through the core. The calculation of the temperature field is done by modeling all fuel channels, which are coupled to each other by a three-dimensional heat conduction equation. For the purpose of validation, the results of the MSR Experiment (MSRE) natural-circulation experiment and the thermal feedback coefficients of the reactor have been calculated and compared.
With the aid of a code system developed to implement this scheme, calculations were carried out for the normal operating state of the MSRE and some debris-induced channel-blocking-incident transients. In the case of the MSRE, it is shown that the severity of such an incident strongly depends on the degree of channel blocking and that high-temperature gradients in the moderator can connect thermally the adjacent fuel channels. Results are included for an unblocking transient (i.e., the debris suddenly exits the core, and the fuel flow reverts to the normal operating pattern), and it was demonstrated that during the unblocking large power peaks can be induced.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-physics modelling (MPM) approach developed for the study of the dynamics of the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which has been reconsidered as one of the future nuclear power plants in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum for its several potentialities. The proposed multi-physics modelling is aimed at the description of the coupling between heat transfer, fluid dynamics and neutronics characteristics in a typical MSR core channel, taking into account the spatial effects of the most relevant physical quantities. In particular, as far as molten salt thermo-hydrodynamics is concerned, Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations are used with the turbulence treatment according to the RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier{\textendash}Stokes) scheme, while the heat transfer is taken into account through the energy balance equations for the fuel salt and the graphite. As far as neutronics is concerned, the two-group diffusion theory is adopted, where the group constants (computed by means of the neutron transport code NEWT of SCALE 5.1) are included into the model in order to describe the neutron flux and the delayed neutron precursor distributions, the system time constants, and the temperature feedback effects of both graphite and fuel salt. The developed MPM approach is implemented in the unified simulation environment offered by COMSOL Multiphysics{\textregistered}, and is applied to study the behaviour of the system in steady-state conditions and under several transients (i.e., reactivity insertion due to control rod movements, fuel mass flow rate variations due to the change of the pump working conditions, presence of periodic perturbations), pointing out some advantages offered with respect to the conventional approaches employed in literature for the MSRs.},

The program culminated in the successful operation of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment in 1965 to 1969. By then the Atomic Energy Commission{\textquoteright}s goals had shifted to breeder development; the molten salt program supported on-site reprocessing development and study of various reactor arrangements that had potential to breed. Some commercial and foreign interest contributed to the program which, however, was terminated by the government in 1976.

	title = {The molten salt fast reactor as a fast spectrum candidate for thorium implementation},
	url = {https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/74324},
	abstract = {The thesis work investigates the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) technology as a possible route to combine the potential advantages of thorium use in Fast Reactors (FR) with the fuel cycle advantages fostered by a liquid fuel. The MSFR emerges as a promising reactor for its capability to operate as a flexible conversion ratio reactor. It shows good performances as U-233 breeder, though uncertainties exist on the U-233 capture cross-section in the neutron energy range of interest for the MSFR. Operation as a self-sustaining reactor fosters low consumption of natural resources, very limited waste generation, and simplified fuel management thanks to the liquid fuel. The MSFR also shows promising features in terms of radioactive waste transmutation thanks to the liquid fuel, the high specific power and the relatively hard spectrum. Safety aspects are investigated through analysis of the reactor safety parameters, and via prediction of the new reactor steady-state after accidental transient initiators. The MSFR inherent safety appears comparable to that of traditional FRs, especially considering its capability to withstand all major double-fault accidents. In addition, the MSFR presents only negative reactivity feedback coefficients, which is a unique feature among fast-spectrum reactors. The system thermal-hydraulics is also investigated in view of the internal heat generation in the working fluid. A correlation is proposed and application to the MSFR allows to exclude major impacts of decay heat on the MSFR out-of-core components, with a note of caution on the design of channels with low velocities and/or large diameters. In addition, a multi-physics model is developed to investigate the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the core, showing some points of enhancement needed in the current MSFR conceptual design. The same model is employed for investigating the reactor transient response to major accidental events, confirming the MSFR promising safety features pointed out with simpler approaches, but suggesting also possible problems related to the quick fuel temperature rise in case of a loss of heat sink.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors (MSRs) represent a class of reactors that use liquid salt, usually fluoride based or chloride based, as either a coolant with a solid fuel (such as fluoride salt{\textendash}cooled high-temperature reactors) or as a combined coolant and fuel with the fuel dissolved in a carrier salt. For liquid-fueled MSRs, the salt can be processed online or in a batch mode to allow for removal of fission products as well as for introduction of fissile fuel and fertile materials during reactor operation. The MSR is most commonly associated with the 233U/thorium fuel cycle, as the nuclear properties of 233U combined with the online removal of parasitic absorbers enable the design of a thermal-spectrum breeder reactor. However, MSR concepts have been developed using all neutron energy spectra (thermal, intermediate, fast, and mixed-spectrum zoned concepts) and with a variety of fuels including uranium, thorium, plutonium, and minor actinides. Early MSR work was supported by a significant research and development (R\&D) program that resulted in two experimental systems operating at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1950s and 1960s: the Aircraft Reactor Experiment and the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. Subsequent design studies in the 1970s focusing on thermal-spectrum thorium-fueled systems established reference concepts for two major design variants: (1) a molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR) with multiple configurations that could breed additional fissile material or maintain self-sustaining operation and (2) a denatured molten salt reactor (DMSR) with enhanced proliferation resistance. MSRs have been selected as one of the Generation IV systems, and development activity has been seen in fast-spectrum MSRs, waste-burning MSRs, and MSRs fueled with low-enriched uranium as well as in more traditional thorium fuel cycle{\textendash}based MSRs. This paper provides a historical background of MSR R\&D efforts, surveys and summarizes many of the recent developments, and provides analysis comparing thorium-based MSRs by way of example.},

After checking data, tabulated and graphical outputs are given in order to offer the most suitable available values to be used as input parameters for other calculations or simulations. The reviewed values show a general scattering in characterization, mainly in thermal properties.

This can be seen in reactor analysis where analysts are interested in coupled flow, heat transfer and neutronics, and in fuel performance simulation where analysts are interested in thermomechanics with contact coupled to species transport and chemistry. These more ambitious simulations usually motivate some level of parallel computing. Many of the coupling efforts to date utilize simple code coupling or first-order operator splitting, often referred to as loose coupling. While these approaches can produce answers, they usually leave questions of accuracy and stability unanswered. Additionally, the different physics often reside on separate grids which are coupled via simple interpolation, again leaving open questions of stability and accuracy. Utilizing state of the art mathematics and software development techniques we are deploying next generation tools for nuclear engineering applications. The Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method combined with physics-based preconditioning provide the underlying mathematical structure for our tools. JFNK is understood to be a modern multiphysics algorithm, but we are also utilizing its unique properties as a scale bridging algorithm. To facilitate rapid development of multiphysics applications we have developed the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment (MOOSE). Examples from two MOOSE-based applications: PRONGHORN, our multiphysics gas cooled reactor simulation tool and BISON, our multiphysics, multiscale fuel performance simulation tool will be presented.},

	abstract = {Jacobian-free Newton{\textendash}Krylov (JFNK) methods are synergistic combinations of Newton-type methods for superlinearly convergent solution of nonlinear equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the Newton correction equations. The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means. Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the JFNK method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. JFNK has potential for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this survey paper, we place JFNK in context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value problems (IVPs). We provide an overview of the mechanics of JFNK and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how JFNK may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide sources of further practical information.},

A physically meaningful weight can be assumed as the solution of the adjoint model, which is constructed for the situation considered, including delayed neutrons. The quasi-static scheme is then applied to calculations of some transients for a typical configuration of a molten-salt reactor, in a multigroup diffusion model with a one-dimensional slug-flow velocity field.

The neutronics and thermal-hydraulics were modified for the MSR peculiarities, where the experience from DYN1D-MSR development was exploited. The code was validated on experimental results from the MSRE experiment done in Oak Ridge National Laboratory and by the comparison with other codes especially with the 1D version. However, by the 3D code transients can be simulated, where space-dependant efforts are relevant, like local blockage of fuel channels or local temperature perturbations.},

	abstract = {The Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) has recently been chosen as the reference circulating-fuel Molten Salt Reactor design in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum. Different from most of the Molten Salt Reactor designs developed and proposed in the past, the MSFR is featured by a fast neutron spectrum. On one hand, this choice leads to a simplified core (no graphite is present) and to improved characteristics in terms of breeding and/or transuranic burning. On the other hand, the removal of graphite leads to a significantly different behavior in terms of both core neutronics and dynamics. In view of the ongoing development of dedicated tools for the MSFR transient simulation, it is useful: 1) to accurately determine the core feedback coefficients, for lumped models and to get an insight into the reactor safety features; and 2) to analyze the degree of approximation related to the use of deterministic multi-group transport and diffusion approaches, in case of multi-dimensional models. The present paper compares the results obtained by means of the deterministic code ERANOS 2.2N with those obtained through the Monte Carlo code PSG2/SERPENT, for different fuel cycle strategies. In particular, the comparison is based on the capability to reproduce nominal reactivity, feedback coefficients, spectra and flux profiles. In the light of these results, the capability of a simple few-group diffusion model to deal with the MSFR neutronics is preliminarily assessed. Such model has been set up by means of the general-purpose finite-element COMSOL Multiphysics software. It is of interest for a subsequent development of multi-physics models able to reproduce the peculiar MSFR transient behavior.},

A wire-wrapped fuel bundle is a complex configuration for which little data is available for verification and validation of new simulation tools.

UGent and NRG performed their simulations with commercially available computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes. The high-fidelity Argonne large-eddy simulations were performed with Nek5000, used for CFD in the Simulation-based High-efficiency Advanced Reactor Prototyping (SHARP) suite. SHARP is a versatile tool that is being developed to model the core of a wide variety of reactor types under various scenarios. It is intended both to serve as a surrogate for physical experiments and to provide insight into experimental results.

Comparison of the results obtained by the different participants with the reference Nek5000 results shows good agreement, especially for the cross-flow data. The comparison also helps highlight issues with current modeling approaches.

The results of the study will be valuable in the design and licensing process of MYRRHA, a flexible fast research reactor under design at SCK{\textperiodcentered}CEN that features wire-wrapped fuel bundles cooled by lead-bismuth eutectic.},

	abstract = {A molten salt reactor (MSR) is a class of generation IV nuclear fission reactor in which the primary nuclear reactor coolant, or even the fuel itself, is a molten salt mixture. MSRs can run at higher temperatures than water-cooled reactors for a higher thermodynamic efficiency, while staying at low vapour pressure.
The nuclear fuel may be solid or dissolved in the coolant. In many designs the nuclear fuel dissolved in the coolant is uranium tetrafluoride (UF4). The fluid becomes critical in a graphite core that serves as the moderator. Some solid-fuel designs propose ceramic fuel dispersed in a graphite matrix, with the molten salt providing low pressure, high temperature cooling. The salts are much more efficient than compressed helium (another potential coolant in Generation IV reactor designs) at removing heat from the core, reducing the need for pumping and piping and reducing the core size.
The concept was established in the 1950s. The early Aircraft Reactor Experiment (1954) was primarily motivated by the small size that the design could provide, while the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (1965{\textendash}1969) was a prototype for a thorium fuel cycle breeder reactor nuclear power plant. The increased research into Generation IV reactor designs included a renewed interest in the technology.},

	abstract = {FLiBe is a molten salt made from a mixture of lithium fluoride (LiF) and beryllium fluoride (BeF2). It is both a nuclear reactor coolant and solvent for fertile or fissile material. It served both purposes in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE).
The 2:1 mixture forms a stoichiometric compound, Li2BeF4, which has a melting point of 459 {\textdegree}C, a boiling point of 1430 {\textdegree}C, and a density of 1.94 g/cm3. Its volumetric heat capacity is 4540 kJ/m3K, which is similar to that of water, more than four times that of sodium, and more than 200 times that of helium at typical reactor conditions. Its appearance is white to transparent, with crystalline grains in a solid state, morphing into a completely clear liquid upon melting. However, soluble fluorides such as UF4 and NiF2, can dramatically change the color salt in both solid and liquid state. This made spectrophotometry a viable analysis tool, and it was employed extensively during the MSRE Operations
The eutectic mixture is slightly greater than 50\% BeF2 and has a melting point of 360 {\textdegree}C. This mixture was never used in practice due to the overwhelming increase in viscosity caused by the BeF2 addition in the eutectic mixture. BeF2, which behaves as a glass, is only fluid in salt mixtures containing enough molar percent of Lewis base. Lewis bases, such as the alkali fluorides, will donate fluoride ions to the beryllium, breaking the glassy bonds which increase viscosity. In FLiBe, beryllium fluoride is able to sequester two fluoride ions from two lithium fluorides in a liquid state, converting it into the tetrafluorberyllate ion BeF4-2.},

In this work, criticality calculation and reactivity changes are presented and discussed using two modelings of the IPR-R1 TRIGA in the MCNP5 code. The first model (Model 1) analyzes the criticality over the reactor. On the other hand, the second model (Model 2) includes the possibility of radial and axial neutron flux evaluation with different operation conditions. The calculated results are compared with experimental data in different situations. For the two models, the standard deviation and relative error presented values of around 4.9 {\texttimes} 10-4. Both models present good agreement with respect to the experimental data. The goal is to validate the models that could be used to determine the neutron flux profiles to optimize the irradiation conditions, as well as to study reactivity insertion experiments and also to evaluate the fuel composition.},

	abstract = {In this work, the Monte Carlo burn-up code SERPENT-2 has been extended and employed to study the material isotopic evolution of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR).

This promising GEN-IV nuclear reactor concept features peculiar characteristics such as the on-line fuel reprocessing, which prevents the use of commonly available burn-up codes. Besides, the presence of circulating nuclear fuel and radioactive streams from the core to the reprocessing plant requires a precise knowledge of the fuel isotopic composition during the plant operation.

The developed extension of SERPENT-2 directly takes into account the effects of on-line fuel reprocessing on burn-up calculations and features a reactivity control algorithm. It is here assessed against a dedicated version of the deterministic ERANOS-based EQL3D procedure (PSI-Switzerland) and adopted to analyze the MSFR fuel salt isotopic evolution.

Particular attention is devoted to study the effects of reprocessing time constants and efficiencies on the conversion ratio and the molar concentration of elements relevant for solubility issues (e.g., trivalent actinides and lanthanides). Quantities of interest for fuel handling and safety issues are investigated, including decay heat and activities of hazardous isotopes (neutron and high energy gamma emitters) in the core and in the reprocessing stream. The radiotoxicity generation is also analyzed for the MSFR nominal conditions.

The production of helium and the depletion in tungsten content due to nuclear reactions are calculated for the nickel-based alloy selected as reactor structural material of the MSFR. These preliminary evaluations can be helpful in studying the radiation damage of both the primary salt container and the axial reflectors.},

	abstract = {The MSR (Molten Salt Reactor) is one of the six innovative concepts of nuclear reactors envisaged by the GIF-IV (Generation IV International Forum) initiative for the long term evolution of the nuclear technology, in the direction of a more sustainable, safe, proliferation resistant, and economic power generation. The MSR is characterised by a complex and highly non-linear behaviour, which requires a careful investigation, as a consequence of some unusual features like the presence of a fluid fuel and the drift of delayed neutron precursors (DNP) along the primary circuit. In this paper, the MSR primary circuit dynamics is analysed with reference to the MSRE (Molten Salt Reactor Experiment), due to the availability of both a detailed design and experimental data. Numerical models featured by increasing complexity are presented. In particular, a zero-dimensional model is developed, and two other models introducing a one-dimensional discretization for the DNP drift and/or the heat convection are also elaborated. These simplified models are then compared with a more complex model, obtained according to an innovative Multi-Physics Modelling (MPM) approach to the dynamic analysis, where the partial differential equations governing the different phenomena in a core channel are solved in a two-dimensional domain, within the same computational environment. A one-dimensional closure of the primary circuit is also provided. The MPM approach gives a unique insight into the influence of local effects on the overall dynamic behaviour of the reactor, while the variety of developed models allows a systematic investigation about the dimensional effects in the modelling of MSRs. This work represents a starting point in the set-up of a Multi-Physics (MP) simulation tool, suitable for calculations with different degrees of accuracy and physical complexity, and paves the way towards the development of MP models capable of a point-by-point coupling of all the phenomena characterising the MSRs, and the nuclear reactors in general.},

Among these reactors, a peculiar role is played by the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), which is the only one with a liquid and circulating fuel. This feature leads to a complex and highly coupled behaviour, which requires careful investigations, as a consequence of some unusual features like the drift of Delayed Neutron Precursors (DNP) along the primary circuit and heat transfer with a heat-generating fluid. The inherently coupled dynamics of the MSRs asks for innovative approaches to perform reliable transient analyses. The node-wise implicitly-coupled solution of the Partial Differential Equations (PDE) that govern the different phenomena in a reactor would offer in this sense an ideal solution. However, such an approach (hereinafter referred to as Multi-Physics {\textendash} MP) requires a huge amount of computational power. In this work, we propose and assess a Geometric Multiscale approach on MSR, addressing the core modelling with a 3-D MP approach and the remaining part of the system {\textendash} e.g., the cooling loop {\textendash} with simplified 0-D models based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). The aim is to conjugate the accuracy of the MP modelling approach with acceptable computation loads. Reference is made to the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), due to the availability of a detailed design and experimental data that are used for assessment and preliminary validation of the developed simulation tool.},

	abstract = {Current interest in advanced nuclear energy and molten salt reactor (MSR) concepts has enhanced interest in building the tools necessary to analyze these systems. A Python script known as ChemTriton has been developed to simulate equilibrium MSR fuel cycle performance by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt using SCALE for neutron transport and depletion calculations. Improved capabilities in ChemTriton include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-zone and multi-fluid systems, enhanced time-dependent feed and separations, and a critical concentration search. Although more generally applicable, the capabilities developed to date are illustrated in this paper in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-based MSR fuel cycle (a likely scenario requires the first of these MSRs to be started without available 233U); (2) determining the effect of the removal of different fission products on MSR operations; and (3) obtaining the equilibrium concentration of a mixed-oxide light-water reactor fuel in a two-stage fuel cycle with a sodium fast reactor. The third problem is chosen to demonstrate versatility in an application to analyze the fuel cycle of a non-MSR system. In the first application, the initial fuel salt compositions fueled with different sources of fissile material are made feasible after (1) removing the associated nonfissile actinides after much of the initial fissile isotopes have burned and (2) optimizing the thorium concentration to maintain a critical configuration without significantly reducing breeding capability. In the second application, noble metal, volatile gas, and rare earth element fission products are shown to have a strong negative effect on criticality in a uranium-fueled thermal-spectrum MSR; their removal significantly increases core lifetime (by 30\%) and fuel utilization. In the third application, the fuel of a mixed-oxide light-water reactor approaches an equilibrium composition after 20 depletion steps, demonstrating the potential for the longer time scales required to achieve equilibrium for solid-fueled systems over liquid fuel systems. This time to equilibrium can be reduced by starting with an initial fuel composition closer to that of the equilibrium fuel, reducing the need to handle time-dependent fuel compositions.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulation of nuclear reactors is a key technology in the quest for improvements in efficiency, safety, and reliability of both existing and future reactor designs. Historically, simulation of an entire reactor was accomplished by linking together multiple existing codes that each simulated a subset of the relevant multiphysics phenomena. Recent advances in the MOOSE (Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment) framework have enabled a new approach: multiple domain-specific applications, all built on the same software framework, are efficiently linked to create a cohesive application. This is accomplished with a flexible coupling capability that allows for a variety of different data exchanges to occur simultaneously on high performance parallel computational hardware. Examples based on the KAIST-3A benchmark core, as well as a simplified Westinghouse AP-1000 configuration, demonstrate the power of this new framework for tackling{\textemdash}in a coupled, multiscale manner{\textemdash}crucial reactor phenomena such as CRUD-induced power shift and fuel shuffle.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The present relates to the integration of the primary functional elements of graphite moderator and reactor vessel and/or primary heat exchangers and/or control rods into an integral molten salt nuclear reactor (IMSR). Once the design life of the IMSR is reached, for example, in the range of 3 to 10 years, it is disconnected, removed and replaced as a unit. The spent IMSR functions as the medium or long term storage of the radioactive graphite and/or heat exchangers and/or control rods and/or fuel salt contained in the vessel of the IMSR. The present also relates to a nuclear reactor that has a buffer salt surrounding the nuclear vessel. During normal operation of the nuclear reactor, the nuclear reactor operates at a temperature that is lower than the melting point of the buffer salt and the buffer salt acts as a thermal insulator. Upon loss of external cooling, the temperature of the nuclear reactor increases and melts the buffer salt, which can then transfer heat from the nuclear core to a cooled containment vessel.},

	abstract = {The family of Generation-IV reactor concepts comprises of multiple promising designs, one of which is the molten salt reactor. These reactors have traditionally been chosen for the possible use of the thorium-uranium fuel cycle and used 7LiF-BeF2 carrier salt. This particular salt choice however presents several challenges due to the cost of highly depleted 7Li isotope for the carrier salt, tritium production, and beryllium toxicity. Additionally, lack of developed and accepted safeguards methodology for thorium fuel cycle presents a barrier. While none of these issues are insurmountable, alternatives are worth investigating. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the more cost effective and regulatory amenable fuel salt choices by using low-enriched uranium fuel in the form of UF4. Several eutectic mixtures are examined that avoid the use of 7Li and Be while maintaining a melting point low enough to be compatible with standard structural materials. The optimal conditions for hexagonal lattice arrangements using nuclear graphite moderation are discussed for multiple fuel salt choices. The aim of this study is to present options of using simpler molten salt reactor alternatives focused on thermal single-fluid low-enriched uranium converter concepts.},

Particular attention is devoted to the description of the adopted time integration and physics coupling strategies. The proposed model features the adoption of an implicit Runge{\textendash}Kutta scheme and the coupling among neutron diffusion, Reynolds-Averaged Navier{\textendash}Stokes equations for mass and momentum conservation, and energy and delayed neutron precursor balance equations, in order to accurately catch thermal feedbacks on neutronics. The solver is aimed at performing fast-running simulations of the full-core three-dimensional Molten Salt Fast Reactor geometry. The neutronics modelling is assessed against Monte Carlo simulations and the results of a simplified case study are compared to those from multiphysics tools previously developed. As an example of the capability of the model, an unprotected MSFR single pump failure accidental scenario is simulated and discussed. The main purpose of the present model is to serve as fast-running computational tool in the phase of design optimization of fuel loop components. More in general, it is of valuable help in the study of reactor physics of circulating-fuel systems.},

	abstract = {The molten salt reactor (MSR) is one of six advanced reactor types in the frame of the Generation 4 International Forum. In this study, a multiple-channel analysis code (MAC) is developed to analyze thermal-hydraulics behavior and MCNP4c is used to study the neutronics behavior of Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). The MAC calculates thermal-hydraulic parameters, namely temperature distribution, flow distribution and pressure drop. The MCNP4c performs the analysis of effective multiplication factor, neutron flux, power distribution and conversion ratio. In this work, the modification of core configuration is achieved by different core zoning and various fuel channel diameters, contributing to flat flux distribution. Specifically, the core is divided into two regions and the effects of different core zoning on the both neutronics and thermal-hydraulic behavior of moderated molten salt reactor are investigated. We conclude that the flat flux distribution cannot always guarantee better performance in thermal-hydraulic perspective and can decreases the graphite lifetime significantly.},

	abstract = {There is currently a renewed interest in molten salt reactors, due to recent conceptual developments on fast neutron spectrum molten salt reactors (MSFRs) using fluoride salts. It has been recognized as a long term alternative to solid-fueled fast neutron systems with a unique potential (large negative temperature and void coefficients, lower fissile inventory, no initial criticality reserve, simplified fuel cycle, wastes reduction etc.) and is thus one of the reference reactors of the Generation IV International Forum. In the MSFR, the liquid fuel processing is part of the reactor where a small side stream of the molten salt is processed for fission product removal and then returned to the reactor. Because of this characteristic, the MSFR can operate with widely varying fuel compositions, so that the MSFR concept may use as initial fissile load, 233U or enriched uranium or also the transuranic elements currently produced by light water reactors. This paper addresses the characteristics of these different launching modes of the MSFR and the Thorium fuel cycle, in terms of safety, proliferation, breeding, and deployment capacities of these reactor configurations. To illustrate the deployment capacities of the MSFR concept, a French nuclear deployment scenario is finally presented, demonstrating that launching the Thorium fuel cycle is easily feasible while closing the current fuel cycle and optimizing the long-term waste management via stockpile incineration in MSRs.},

	abstract = {The molten salt reactor (MSR), as one of the Generation IV advanced nuclear systems, has attracted a worldwide interest due to its excellent performances in safety, economics, sustainability, and proliferation resistance. The aim of this work is to provide and evaluate possible solutions to fissile 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production and further the fuel transition to thorium fuel cycle in a thermal MSR by using plutonium partitioned from light water reactors spent fuel. By using an in-house developed tool, a breeding and burning (B\&B) scenario is first introduced and analyzed from the aspects of the evolution of main nuclides, net 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production, spectrum shift, and temperature feedback coefficient. It can be concluded that such a Th/Pu to Th/233UTh/233U{\textbackslash}hbox \{Th\}/{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} transition can be accomplished by employing a relatively fast fuel reprocessing with a cycle time less than 60 days. At the equilibrium state, the reactor can achieve a conversion ratio of about 0.996 for the 60-day reprocessing period (RP) case and about 1.047 for the 10-day RP case. The results also show that it is difficult to accomplish such a fuel transition with limited reprocessing (RP is 180 days), and the reactor operates as a converter and burns the plutonium with the help of thorium. Meanwhile, a pre-breeding and burning (PB\&B) scenario is also analyzed briefly with respect to the net 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production and evolution of main nuclides. One can find that it is more efficient to produce 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} under this scenario, resulting in a double time varying from about 1.96 years for the 10-day RP case to about 6.15 years for the 180-day RP case.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) were conceived at the early stages of nuclear energy in view of the favourable features fostered by a liquid fuel. They were developed as graphite-moderated thorium-fuelled breeder reactors till the seventies, when studies on this reactor concept were mostly abandoned in favour of the liquid{\textendash}metal fast breeder concepts. A decade ago, the MSRs were included among the six GEN-IV systems and a core optimization process allowing for the GEN-IV main objectives led toward a fast-spectrum MSR concept (MSFR {\textendash} Molten Salt Fast Reactor). Albeit advantageous in terms of U-233 breeding and/or radio-active waste burning, the new concept lacks the notable know-how available for the thermal-spectrum MSR technology. The present paper preliminarily investigates the MSR dynamics, based on the conceptual MSFR design currently available. A primary objective is to benchmark two different models of the MSFR primary circuit, both of them including a detailed and fully-coupled (node-wise) representation of turbulent fuel-salt flow, neutron diffusion, and delayed-neutron precursor diffusion and convection. A good agreement is generally observed between the adopted models, though some discrepancies exist in the temperature-field, with ensuing mild impacts on the reactor dynamics. The performed analyses are also used for a preliminary characterization of the MSFR steady-state and accidental transient response. Some points of enhancement needed in the MSFR conceptual design are identified, mainly related to in-core velocity and temperature fields. The reactor response following major accidental transient initiators suggests a generally benign behaviour of this reactor concept.},

Many countries worldwide contribute to this reactor technology, among which the European Union, France, Japan, Russia and the USA, and for the past few years China and India have also contributed. In general, the international R\&D focuses on three main lines of research. The USA focuses on the FHR, which will be a nearer-term application of liquid salt as a reactor coolant, while China also focuses on solid fuel reactors as a precursor to molten salt reactors with liquid fuel and a thermal neutron spectrum. The EU, France and Russia are focusing on the development of a fast spectrum molten salt reactor capable of either breeding or transmutation of actinides from spent nuclear fuel. Future research topics focus on liquid salt technology and materials behavior, the fuel and fuel cycle chemistry and modeling, and the numerical simulation and safety design aspects of the reactor. MSR development attracts more and more attention every year, because it is generally considered as most sustainable of the six Generation-IV designs with intrinsic safety features.

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) are liquid-fuel reactors, in which the fuel is also the coolant and flows through the core. A particular configuration presented in this paper called the Molten Salt Fast Reactor consists in a Molten Salt Reactor with no moderator inside the core and a salt composition that leads to a fast neutron spectrum. Previous studies showed that this concept (previously called Thorium Molten Salt Reactor {\textendash} Nonmoderated) has very promising characteristics. The liquid fuel implies a special reprocessing. Each day a small amount of the fuel salt is extracted from the core for on-site reprocessing. To study such a reactor, the materials evolution within the core has to be coupled to the reprocessing unit, since the latter cleans the salt quasi continuously and feeds the reactor. This paper details the issues associated to the numerical coupling of the core and the reprocessing. It presents how the chemistry is introduced inside the classical Bateman equation (evolution of nuclei within a neutron flux) in order to carry a numerical coupled study. To achieve this goal, the chemistry has to be modeled numerically and integrated to the equations of evolution. This paper presents how is it possible to describe the whole concept (reactor+reprocessing unit) by a system of equations that can be numerically solved. Our program is a connection between MCNP and a homemade evolution code called REM. Thanks to this tool; constraints on the fuel reprocessing were identified. Limits are specified to preserve the good neutronics properties of the MSFR. In this paper, we show that the limit rate for the reprocessing is 2.5l of fuel salt a day, which means that the fuel should be reprocessed within 7000days approximately if there is a specific way to control the redox potential of the salt. Finally, a last part of this paper analyzes the impact of chemical parameter uncertainties on the reprocessing performance.},

We have implemented the POD-based solver in the large eddy simulation code Nek5000 and used it to solve the advection-diffusion equation for temperature in cases where buoyancy is not present. POD allows for the identification of the most energetic modes of turbulence when applied to a sufficient set of snapshots generated through Nek5000. The Navier-Stokes equations are then reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations by Galerkin projection. The flow field is reconstructed and used to advect the temperature on longer time scales and potentially coarser grids. The methodology is validated and tested on two problems: two-dimensional flow past a cylinder and three-dimensional flow in T-junctions. For the latter case, the benchmark chosen corresponds to the experiments of Hirota et al., who performed particle image velocimetry on the flow in a counterflow T-junction. In both test problems the dynamics of the reduced-order model reproduce well the history of the projected modes when a sufficient number of equations are considered. The dynamics of flow evolution and the interaction of different modes are also studied in detail for the T-junction.},

Its design philosophy emphasizes radioactive waste removal, nonproliferation, and safety principles governed by the laws of physics rather than complex engineering. The reactor is fueled by a mixture of thorium and transuranics (TRUs) from high-level nuclear waste, dissolved in a sodium fluoride-based carrier salt. Over the 60-year reactor lifetime, the MSTW is able to reduce 5 metric tonnes of TRUs to shorter-lived fission products and energy. With an outlet temperature of up to 900{\textdegree}C, the reactor supports a wide variety of process heat applications, in addition to electricity production. Together with the simplified safety methodology and a fully modularized design approach, this ensures attractive economics. The design is currently in the conceptual stage, with efforts focusing on advanced neutronics, multiphysics, and early engineering studies.},

	abstract = {The IMSR uses molten fluoride salt, a highly stable, inert liquid with robust coolant properties and high intrinsic radionuclide retention properties, for its primary fuel salt. A secondary, coolant salt loop, also using a fluoride salt (but without fuel), transfers heat away from the primary heat exchangers integrated inside the core-unit. The coolant salt loop, in turn, transfers its heat load to a solar salt loop, which is pumped out of the nuclear island to a separate building where it either heats steam generators that generate superheated steam for power generation or is used for process heat applications. The safety philosophy behind the IMSR is to produce a nuclear power plant with generation IV reactor levels of safety. For ultimate safety, there is no dependence on operator intervention, powered mechanical components, coolant injection or their support systems, such as electricity supply or instrument air in dealing with upset conditions. This is achieved through a combination of design features: the inert, stable properties of the salt; an inherently stable nuclear core; fully passive backup core and containment cooling systems; and an integral reactor architecture.},

	abstract = {Moltres is a physics application for multiphysics modeling of fluid-fueled molten salt reactors
(MSRs) (Lindsay et al. 2018). It couples equations for neutron diffusion, thermal
hydraulics, and delayed neutron precursor transport. Neutron diffusion and precursor
transport equations are set-up using an action system that allows the user to use an arbitrary
number of neutron energy and precursor groups respectively with minimal input
changes. Moltres sits on top of the Multi-physics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment
(Gaston et al. 2015) and hence uses the finite element method to discretize the
governing partial differential equations. In general the resulting system of non-linear algebraic
equations is linearized using the Newton-Raphson method and then solved using
the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (Balay et al. 2017). Assembly
of the Jacobian and residual, and the linear solve are parallelized using MPI which
allows Moltres to be run in massively parallel environments. Runs on the Blue Waters
supercomputer at Illinois have utilized up to 608 cores.
Moltres and MOOSE allow use of different basis functions for different system variables.
Because of the purely diffusive nature of the neutron diffusion equations, neutron fluxes are
typically discretized using continuous first-degree Lagrange polynomials and the degrees of
freedom are associated with mesh nodes. The temperature variable may also be discretized
with a continuous Lagrange basis, or a discontinuous basis of arbitrary degree monomials
may be employed depending on the relative balance of heat convection to conduction. The
purely hyperbolic precursor transport is currently discretized using constant monomials,
which is equivalent to a first-order finite volume discretization. Moltres supports both
segregated (through Picard iteration) and monolithic solutions of the equation system.
However, due to the feedback between the power spectrum and temperature dependence
of macroscopic cross-sections, monolithic solves have demonstrated superior robustness
with segregated techniques often unable to converge to a solution. This result emphasizes
the importance of a fully coupled multi-physics framework like the one that Moltres and
MOOSE provide and suggests that iteratively coupling codes devoted to single physics
(K{\'o}ph{\'a}zi, Lathouwers, and Kloosterman 2009) may result in limited flexibility.},

Traditionally these reactors are thought of as thermal breeder reactors running on the thorium to 233U cycle and the historical competitor to fast breeder reactors. In the recent years, there has been a growing interest in molten salt reactors, which have been considered in the framework of the Generation IV International Forum, because of their several potentialities and favorable features when compared with conventional solid-fueled reactors. MSRs meet many of the future goals of nuclear energy, in particular for what concerns an improved sustainability, an inherent safety with strong negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, stable coolant, low pressure operation that don not require expensive containment, easy to control, passive decay heat cooling and unique characteristics in terms of actinide burning and waste reduction, while benefiting from the past experience acquired with the molten salt technology. As the only liquid-fueled reactor concept, the safety basis, characteristics and licensing of an MSR are different from solid-uranium fueled light water reactors. In this paper, a historical review of the major plant systems in MSR is presented. The features of different safety characteristics of MSR power plant are reviewed and assessment in comparison to other solid fueled light water reactors LWRs.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from biomass combustion are traditionally assumed climate neutral if the bioenergy system is carbon (C) flux neutral, i.e. the CO2 released from biofuel combustion approximately equals the amount of CO2 sequestered in biomass. This convention, widely adopted in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies of bioenergy systems, underestimates the climate impact of bioenergy. Besides CO2 emissions from permanent C losses, CO2 emissions from C flux neutral systems (that is from temporary C losses) also contribute to climate change: before being captured by biomass regrowth, CO2 molecules spend time in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. In this paper, a method to estimate the climate impact of CO2 emissions from biomass combustion is proposed. Our method uses CO2 impulse response functions (IRF) from C cycle models in the elaboration of atmospheric decay functions for biomass-derived CO2 emissions. Their contributions to global warming are then quantified with a unit-based index, the GWPbio. Since this index is expressed as a function of the rotation period of the biomass, our results can be applied to CO2 emissions from combustion of all the different biomass species, from annual row crops to slower growing boreal forest.},

The fluid fuel in these reactors, consisting of UF4 and ThF4 dissolved in fluorides of beryllium and lithium, is circulated through a reactor core moderated by graphite. Technology developments over the past 20 years have culminated in the successful operation of the 8-MW(th) MoltenSalt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), and have indicated that operation with a molten fuel is practical, that the salt is stable under reactor conditions, and that corrosion is very low. Processing of the MSRE fuel has demonstrated the MSR processing associated with high-performance converters. New fuel processing methods under development should permit MSR{\textquoteright}s to operate as economical breeders. These features, combined with high thermal efficiency (44\%) and low primary system pressure, give MSR converters and breeders potentially favorable economic, fuel utilization, and safety characteristics. Further, these reactors can be initially fueled with 233U, 235U, or plutonium. The construction cost of an MSBR power plant is estimated to be about the same as that of light-water reactors. This could lend to power costs 0.5 to 1.0 mill/kWh less than those for light-water reactors. Achievement of economic molten-salt breeder reactors requires the construction and operation of several reactors of increasing size and their associated processing plants.},

Presently the country has stepped into the 2nd Stage. The transition from the Stage 1 to 2 was fruitful thanks to the 2-decade long R\&D experience gained in Fast Reactor Fuel Reprocessing (FRFR). Closing the fast reactor fuel cycle through FRFR was inevitable for the success of the Indian Nuclear Power Program (INPP). The latest achievement by the center was the successful reprocessing of 100 GWd/t burnup mixed carbide fuel with 70\% Pu, discharged from the Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) which is also located in the same center. The designs of the various equipments and process flow sheet had stemmed from the above experiences thereby increasing the confidence level in the future plans of the Department. In this paper, an overview of the experiences in FRFR with glimpses of the various developmental activities towards the future plants is spelt out.},

MOSART is one of conceptual designs in the molten salt reactor (MSR) category of the Generation-IV systems. This type of reactors is distinguished by the use of liquid fuel circulating in and out of the core, which offers many unique advantages but complicates the modeling and simulation of core behavior using conventional reactor physics codes. The TRITON control module in SCALE6 can perform reliable depletion and decay analysis for many reactor physics applications due to its problem-dependent cross-section processing and rigorous treatment of neutron transport. In order to accommodate a simulation of on-line refueling and reprocessing scenarios, several in-house programs together with a run script were developed to integrate a series of stepwise TRITON calculations; the result greatly facilitates the neutronics analyses of long-term MSR operation. Using this method, a detailed reexamination of the MOSART operation in 30years was performed to investigate the neutronic characteristics of the core design, the change of fuel salt composition from start-up to equilibrium, the effects of various salt reprocessing scenarios, the performance of actinide transmutation, and the radiotoxicity reduction.},

	abstract = {The adoption of Th fuel in fast reactors is being reconsidered due to the potential favorable impact on actinide waste management and resource availability. A closed Th cycle leads to an actinide inventory with lower radiotoxicity and heat load for the first several thousands of years. Due to the typically low TRansUranic (TRU) Conversion Ratio (CR), Th can also be advantageous to expedite the consumption of legacy TRU. One of the main obstacles to the implementation of Th is the highly radioactive recycled fuel which requires remote handling under heavy shielding, inevitably penalizing economics and challenging conventional pin-based fuel manufacturing. From this perspective, the development of liquid-fuelled reactors, with Molten Salt Reactors regarded as the most promising, appears particularly attractive as fuel handling would be greatly simplified. The present paper investigates the fuel cycle performances of the reference GEN-IV Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) in terms of isotope evolution, radiotoxicity generation and safety-related parameters. Similarly to most MSR concepts proposed in the past, the MSFR is based on the fluoride molten salt technology, but it features the novelty of a fast neutron spectrum. Calculations are performed using state-of-the-art equilibrium-cycle methodologies, i.e., the ERANOS-based EQL3D procedure developed at the Paul Scherrer Institut and extended to the simulation of the MSFR. Selected results have been benchmarked with the Monte Carlo code PSG2/SERPENT. These results have also been used for the assessment of a diffusion module based on the COMSOL multi-physics toolkit, which is the subject of current studies aimed at efficiently simulating the peculiar MSFR transient behavior.},

	abstract = {The CNRS has been involved in molten salt reactors since 1997. Starting from the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor project of Oak-Ridge, an innovative concept called Molten Salt Fast Reactor or MSFR has been proposed, resulting from extensive parametric studies in which various core arrangements, reprocessing performances and salt compositions were investigated to adapt the reactor in the framework of the deployment of a thorium based reactor fleet on a worldwide scale. The primary feature of the MSFR concept is the removal of the graphite moderator from the core (graphite-free core), resulting in a breeder reactor with a fast neutron spectrum and operated in the Thorium fuel cycle. MSFR has been recognized as a long term alternative to solid fuelled fast neutron systems with unique potential (negative safety coefficients, smaller fissile inventory, easy in-service inspection, simplified fuel cycle{\textellipsis}) and has thus been selected for further studies by the Generation IV International Forum in 2008.In the MSFR, the liquid fuel processing is part of the reactor where a small side stream of the molten salt is processed for fission product removal and then returned to the reactor. This is fundamentally different from a solid fuel reactor where separate facilities produce the solid fuel and process the Spent Nuclear Fuel. Because of this design characteristic, the MSFR can thus operate with widely varying fuel composition. Thanks to this fuel composition flexibility, the MSFR concept may use as initial fissile load, {\textless}sup{\textgreater}233{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}U or enriched (between 5\% and 30\%) uranium or also the transuranic elements currently produced by PWRs in the world.Our reactor{\textquoteright}s studies of the MSFR concept rely on numerical simulations making use of the MCNP neutron transport code coupled with a code for materials evolution which resolves the Bateman{\textquoteright}s equations giving the population of each nucleus inside each part of the reactor at each moment. Because of MSR{\textquoteright}s fundamental characteristics compared to classical solid-fuelled reactors, the classical Bateman equations have to be modified by adding two terms representing the reprocessing efficiencies and the fertile or fissile alimentation. We have finally coupled neutronic and reprocessing simulation codes in a numerical tool develop to calculate the evolution of the whole MSFR system. This tool is used to evaluate the extraction capacities of fission products and their location in the whole system (reactor and reprocessing unit), basis of any safety and radioprotection assessment of the reactor., Le CNRS s{\textquoteright}int{\'e}resse aux r{\'e}acteurs {\`a} sels fondus (RSF) depuis 1997.

Il s{\textquoteright}agit d{\textquoteright}un concept de r{\'e}acteur surr{\'e}g{\'e}n{\'e}rateur {\`a} spectre neutronique rapide et en cycle Thorium, qui pr{\'e}sente une tr{\`e}s bonne stabilit{\'e} intrins{\`e}que de fonctionnement gr{\^a}ce {\`a} des coefficients de s{\^u}ret{\'e} tous n{\'e}gatifs, et un processus de retraitement du combustible in-situ simplifi{\'e} acceptable d{\textquoteright}un point de vue {\'e}conomique. Ce r{\'e}acteur se place dans le contexte d{\textquoteright}une fili{\`e}re d{\textquoteright}utilisation du Thorium qui est un {\'e}l{\'e}ment fertile abondant dans la nature, en association avec des {\'e}l{\'e}ments fissiles naturels ({\textless}sup{\textgreater}235{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}U) ou non ({\textless}sup{\textgreater}233{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}U) ou encore qui proviennent de la chaine de gestion des {\'e}l{\'e}ments radioactifs {\`a} vie longue des r{\'e}acteurs actuels (Np, Pu, Am, {\textellipsis}).Les {\'e}tudes men{\'e}es sont bas{\'e}es sur le couplage du code de transport de neutrons MCNP avec le code d{\textquoteright}{\'e}volution des mat{\'e}riaux REM d{\'e}velopp{\'e} au CNRS. La r{\'e}solution des {\'e}quations de Bateman qui est effectu{\'e}e permet de conna{\^i}tre la population de chaque noyau dans chaque partie du r{\'e}acteur {\`a} chaque instant. Du fait des caract{\'e}ristiques fondamentales des RSF qui sont tr{\`e}s diff{\'e}rentes de celles des r{\'e}acteurs {\`a} combustible solide, ces {\'e}quations doivent {\^e}tre modifi{\'e}es pour prendre en compte la capacit{\'e} d{\textquoteright}alimentation en mati{\`e}re fissile et fertile, ainsi que le retraitement du sel combustible, de mani{\`e}re continue sans arr{\^e}t du r{\'e}acteur. Nous avons finalement associ{\'e} le code d{\'e}crivant l{\textquoteright}{\'e}volution du coeur et une repr{\'e}sentation simul{\'e}e du retraitement pour construire un outil num{\'e}rique servant au calcul de l{\textquoteright}{\'e}volution du syst{\`e}me complet.

	abstract = {We discuss here the concept of Thorium Molten Salt Reactor dedicated to future nuclear energy production. The fuel of such reactors being liquid, it can be easily reprocessed to overcome neutronic limits. In the late sixties, the MSBR project showed that breeding is possible with thorium in a thermal spectrum, provided that an efficient pyrochemical reprocessing is added. With tools developed around the Monte Carlo MCNP code, we first re-evaluate the performance of a MSBR-like reference system with 232Th/233U fuel. We find an important reduction of inventories and induced radiotoxicities at equilibrium compared to other fuel cycles, with a doubling time of about thirty years. We then study how to start this interesting reference system with theplutonium from PWR spent fuel. Such a transition appears slow and difficult, since it is very sensitive to the fissile quality of the plutonium used. Deployment scenarios of 232Th/233U MSBR-like systems from the existing French PWRs demonstrate the advantage of an upstream 233U production in other reactors, allowing a direct start of the MSBR-like systems with 233U. This finally leads us to explore alternatives to some MSBR features, for energy production with 232Th/233U fuel from the start. We thus test different options, especially in terms of core neutronics optimization and reprocessing unit adaptation.},

Both codes allow explicit geometric representation of the target systems and are used internationally for safety analyses involving fissile materials. KENO V.a has limiting geometric rules such as no intersections and no rotations. These limitations make KENO V.a execute very efficiently and run very fast. On the other hand, KENO-VI allows very complex geometric modeling. Both KENO codes can utilize either continuous-energy or multigroup cross-section data and have been thoroughly verified and validated with ENDF libraries through ENDF/B-VII.0, which has been first distributed with SCALE 6. Development of the Monte Carlo solution technique and solution methodology as applied in both KENO codes is explained in this paper. Available options and proper application of the options and techniques are also discussed. Finally, performance of the codes is demonstrated using published benchmark problems.},

Good decontamination is obtained in the fluorination step due to the low volatility of most of the fission product fluorides. An over-all decontamination factor greater than 106 with adequate uranium recovery has been demonstrated in laboratory scale tests using a double bed procedure for the NaF step. A pilot plant has been constructed for testing the process with various heterogeneous fuel elements. The engineering and operational features of the pilot plant are described.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) was selected as one of the six innovative nuclear reactors by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF). The circulating-fuel in the can-type molten salt fast reactor makes the neutronics and thermo-hydraulics of the reactor strongly coupled and different from that of traditional solid-fuel reactors. In the present paper, a new coupling model is presented that physically describes the inherent relations between the neutron flux, the delayed neutron precursor, the heat transfer and the turbulent flow. Based on the model, integrating nuclear data processing, CAD modeling, structured and unstructured mesh technology, data analysis and visualization application, a three dimension steady state simulation code system (MSR3DS) for the can-type molten salt fast reactor is developed and validated. In order to demonstrate the ability of the code, the three dimension distributions of the velocity, the neutron flux, the delayed neutron precursor and the temperature were obtained for the simplified MOlten Salt Advanced Reactor Transmuter (MOSART) using this code. The results indicate that the MSR3DS code can provide a feasible description of multi-physical coupling phenomena in can-type molten salt fast reactor. Furthermore, the code can well predict the flow effect of fuel salt and the transport effect of the turbulent diffusion.},

	abstract = {The molten salt reactor is one of the six concepts retained by the Generation IV forum in 2001. Based on the MSRE and MSBR concepts developed by ORNL in the 60s which involve a liquid fuel constituted of fluorine molten salt at a temperature close to 600{\textdegree}C, new developments with innovative approach and technology have been realized which contribute to strongly improve the concept. The thorium breeder potentiality is closely related to the use of a liquid fuel which is able to be periodically treated. A reprocessing scheme has been established to treat used fuel by extraction of fission products. According to the Gen IV philosophy for closed cycle nuclear reactor, the actinides are sent back in the reactor core. In this way, the wastes radiotoxicity is strongly decreased and the use of natural resource is optimized. This paper describes an innovative reactor concept, the TMSR-NM (non-moderated thorium molten salt reactor), from the nuclear physic point of view and the different steps involving in the reprocessing scheme from the chemical point of view.},

The matrices are generated once using the Monte Carlo neutron transport MCNP prior to the kinetic calculations. This article is devoted to the description of this approach with two different sets of equations depending on the aimed precision. We tested the TFM approach in several instances. In the calculation of the kinetic parameters such as $\beta$eff and $\Lambda$eff on the Flattop and Jezebel experiments, the results obtained are compatible with adjoint weighted calculations performed with the Monte Carlo neutron transport code SERPENT. Likewise, our calculated value of the $\alpha$Rossi observable is also compatible with the experimental measurement. Finally a time{\textendash}space prompt neutron propagation induced by a neutron pulse on Flattop has been calculated using the TFM approach and compared to a reference time dependent SERPENT calculation. Again, the results obtained demonstrate the good characterization of the time{\textendash}space system response by the TFM approach.},

	abstract = {Current interest in advanced nuclear energy and MSR concepts has enhanced demand in building the tools to analyze these systems. This thesis introduces a Python script, SaltProc, which simulates MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt. SaltProc couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT 2, for neutron transport and depletion calculations. SaltProc capabilities include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-region and multi-flow systems, time-dependent feeds and removals, and specific separation efficiency for each element or isotope removal flow. Generally applicable capabilities are illuminated in this thesis in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-fueled MSBR fuel cycle to find equilibrium fuel composition (when multiplication factor of the full-core model and the U-233 concentration in the fuel salt are invariant in time); (2) determining the effect of the fuel salt irradiation with online reprocessing on MSBR operations; and (3) estimating MSBR fuel cycle performance by computing the Th-232 feed rate over 20 years of operation and comparing with available data. In the first application, full-core depletion in the MSBR demonstrated that (1) equilibrium fuel composition could be achieved after 16 years and (2) the multiplication factor stabilizes after 6 years of operation. In the second application, fuel salt irradiation with simulated fission product removal and fissile/fertile feed causes considerable neutron energy spectrum hardening; this spectral shift has a problematic impact on safety parameters (e.g., temperature reactivity feedback, reactivity control system worth). In the third application, the average Th-232 feed rate throughout 20 years of operation is 2.39 kg/day or 100 g/GWh(e) which is a good agreement with other recent research. Problematic effects of neutron energy spectrum hardening during MSBR operation should be taken into account for neutronics, multi-physics, and fuel cycle performance analysis.},

	abstract = {The fuel cycle performance and core design of the Transatomic Power liquid-fueled molten salt reactor concept is analyzed. This advanced reactor concept uses configurable zirconium hydride moderator rod assemblies to shift the neutron spectrum in the core from intermediate at beginning of life to thermal at end of life. With a harder spectrum during the early years of reactor operation, this spectral shift design drives captures in fertile 238U. The converted fissile plutonium makes up over 50\% of the fissile material in the fuel salt over the last half (\~{}15 years) of reactor operation. A softer spectrum late in reactor life helps drive the fuel to a burnup of 90 GWd/MTU. Continuously changing physics necessitates time-dependent analyses resolved over long timescales (i.e., months to years), as this concept does not meet an equilibrium condition. The spectral shift and molten salt reactor material feeds and removals enable this concept to perform better in fuel cycle metrics, increasing resource utilization by more than 50\% compared with a typical light water reactor (i.e., from \~{}0.6\% to \~{}1\%). These metrics are compared to similar fuel cycles using alternate technologies. Additional core design and analysis challenges associated with the spectral shift and use of molten salt reactor technology are identified and discussed.},

Thus, interest in advanced nuclear energy and particularly Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) has resurged, with multiple new companies pursuing commercialization of MSR designs (e.g. Transatomic, Terrapower, Terrestrial, Moltex Energy, Thorcon). To further develop these MSR concepts, researchers need simulation tools for analyzing liquid fueled MSR depletion and fuel processing. However, most contemporary nuclear reactor physics software is unable to perform high-fidelity full-core depletion calculations for a reactor design with online reprocessing. This paper introduces a Python package, SaltProc, which couples with the Monte Carlo code, SERPENT2, to simulate MSR online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of MSR fuel salt. This work demonstrates SaltProc capabilities for a full-core, high-fidelity model of the commercial Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) concept and verifies these results to results in the literature from independent, lower-fidelity analyses.},

	abstract = {Compressible fluid dynamics is of great practical interest in many industrial applications, ranging from chemistry to aeronautical industry, and to nuclear field as well. At the same time, modelling and simulation of compressible flows is a very complex task, requiring the development of specific approaches, in order to describe the effect of pressure on the fluid velocity field. Compressibility effects become even more important in the study of two-phase flows, due to the presence of a gaseous phase. In addition, compressibility is also expected to have a significant impact on other physics, such as chemical or nuclear reactions occurring in the mixture. In this perspective, multiphysics represents a useful approach to address this complex problem, providing a way to catch all the different physics that come into play as well as the coupling between them. In this work, a multiphysics model is developed for the analysis of the generation IV Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), with a specific focus on the compressibility effects of the fluid that acts as fuel in the reactor. The fuel mixture compressibility is expected to have an important effect on the system dynamics, especially in very rapid super-prompt-critical transients. In addition, the presence of a helium bubbling system used for online fission product removal could modify the fuel mixture compressibility, further affecting the system transient behaviour. Therefore, the MSFR represents an application of concrete interest, inherent to the analysis of compressibility effects and to the development of suitable modelling approaches. An OpenFOAM solver is developed to handle the fuel compressibility, the presence of gas bubbles in the reactor as well as the coupling between the system neutronics and fluid dynamics. The outcomes of this analysis point out that the fuel compressibility plays a crucial role in the evolution of fast transients, introducing delays in the expansion feedbacks that strongly affect the system dynamics. Moreover, it is found that the gas bubbles significantly alter the fuel compressibility, yielding even larger differences compared to the incompressible approximation usually adopted in the current MSFR solvers.},

The reactor and the processing plant are planned as an integral system. The main functions of the processing plant will be to isolate 233Pa from the neutron flux and to remove the rare-earth fission products. The processing method being developed involves the selective chemical reduction of the various components into liquid bismuth solutions at 600{\textdegree}C, utilizing multistage counter-current extraction. Protactinium, which is easily separated from uranium, thorium, and the rare earths, would be trapped in the salt phase in a storage tank located between two extraction contactors and allowed to decay to 233U. Rare earths would be separated from thorium by a similar reductive extraction method; however, this operation will not be as simple as the protactinium isolation step because the rare-earth-thorium separation factors are only 1.3 to 3.5. The proposed process would employ electrolytic cells to simultaneously introduce reductant into the bismuth phase at the cathode and to return extracted materials to the salt phase at the anode. The practicability of the reductive extraction process depends on the successful development of salt-metal contactors, electrolytic cells, and suitable materials of construction.},

	abstract = {System analysis codes have a long history of providing best-estimate and conservative safety analysis for both light water and advanced reactor technologies, including molten salt reactors. As interest continues to expand with advanced reactor concepts, system analysis codes will need revisions to accommodate the behavior of these technologies. Legacy system analysis codes will need to be updated to the latest numerical techniques to shorten execution time and increase the accuracy of results. One example of a modern system analysis code that already encompasses these characteristics is the System Analysis Module (SAM). One key objective of this paper was to review available information for system code modeling of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) from sources in the open literature and collect the information from these open sources in one place for the first time. This supports the potential objective of developing an open specification for system code analysis for MSRE steady state and transients with and without reactor kinetics. Data from actual MSRE tests will serve as the basis for code-to-code comparison exercises, including the MSRE zero power physics tests, the fuel pump start-up and coast down tests, and the natural circulation transient. The objective is to produce a code-to-code benchmark with a standardized set of comparison problems, recognizing the limitations of the original data. To demonstrate an initial application of this objective and the usefulness of compiling this open data, two Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE)-related models were developed to evaluate SAM for liquid fueled molten salt reactors. One model was the SAM MSRE hydraulic mockup, which provided experimental data for pressure drop measurements. The second model was the complete MSRE primary loop. The MSRE primary loop model incorporated a fluoride salt fuel/coolant with heat transfer in both the core and heat exchanger. For both the hydraulic mockup and MSRE primary loop models, a holistic 1-D system description was built using open documentation, an open description that can be readily modified and applied for any system analysis code. SAM results for the pressure drop of the hydraulic mockup model were within 6\% with measurements. Coolant temperatures for the primary loop model matched the expected axial change in temperature from historical calculations. Using alternative coolant properties obtained from the literature, corresponding to salts with different actinide contents, returned similar trends in core temperature profiles. A thermal hydraulic demonstration of a loss-of-flow transient showed the importance of coupling SAM thermal hydraulic analysis to neutronics. This coupling is essential for simulating MSR transients with system analysis codes.},

This paper discusses a coupled point kinetics model and a two-dimensional diffusion model. The former is based on the point kinetics equations with six groups of delayed neutrons and the lumped capacitance heat transfer equations. To account for the reflector effect on neutron lifetime, additional (fictional) groups of delayed neutrons are added in the point kinetics equations to represent the thermalized neutrons coming back from the reflectors. The latter is based on coupled multi-group neutron diffusion and finite element heat transfer model. Multi-group cross sections and diffusion coefficients are generated using the Monte Carlo code Serpent and defined as input in COMSOL 5.0.},
